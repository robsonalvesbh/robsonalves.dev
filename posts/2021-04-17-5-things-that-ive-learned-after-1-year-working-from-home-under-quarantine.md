This kind of post become normal after starts the quarantine, but whatever, I wanna show my thoughts and what I've learned after 1 year of working from home I experienced a lot of things that I needed to adapt to be more productive and grow in my career, I list 5 things that are useful to me on my daily basis.


## Learn to work asynchronously
Before the pandemic we were used to working synchronous, if I was in doubt, I would get up from my station, walk to my mate's station and ask her for help. 

When the pandemic came out we rapidly needed to start working from home and the way we were used to working changed, now I don't have my mate on my side and normally we chat using a tool like Slack, even though I send a message to her, she maybe is not available right now to answer my questions, maybe she is in a meeting, maybe she is focused, maybe she isn't available, there are a thousand reasons to her later to answer.

An efficient way to improve communication in a remote team is to have asynchronous communication, we need to be patient and change our mindset about how the interaction with our teammates working remotely works.

## People need to be in touch
If I need to choose a topic that I miss most working from the office, it is the interaction with my colleagues, the chatting in the kitchen, the lunch with them, the beer after the daily work, and the snooker matches.

The social was one of the things  at work most affected by the pandemic, we needed to learn other ways to socialize with each other, below some rituals we are trying with this purpose:

#### Happy Hour weekly   
This is the most common event the teams adopted, a weekly event to talk about anything, maybe drink a beer, and have a fun moment with our teammates.

####  Virtual Coffee
Maybe once or twice a week we have 15-30 minutes to socializing in a virtual coffee.

#### Today I Learned channel
A Slack channel to share with the team an article/video/blog post that I've learned and I guessed it's interesting to share with the teammates.


## Good infrastructure to work at home

- Good Setup
- Good Internet
Good time management
- Working from home It's hard to change the context and stop working, so keep working until late may become normal, but it's not good for health.
- Set a time to start working and to stop working
Do exercise
- Wake up and set in the chair and stop just to sleep
